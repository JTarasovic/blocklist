# blocklist

This repo exists to build blocklists for my personal network.

## steven-black-unified-unbound

Generates a configuration suitable for `include`ing by Unbound.

The list of hosts to block is sourced from [StevenBlack/hosts](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts).

The file is generated by Github Actions every 6 hours via cron schedule.


## TODO
- [ ] prevent obviously bad changes from being committed (e.g. no blocklist, double list, etc)
- [ ] figure out exclusion (or move to unbound and remove from here?)
- [ ] convert CI job to matrix
- [ ] add additional block lists (e.g. `nftables` sets)
